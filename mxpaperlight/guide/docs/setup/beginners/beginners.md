# For absolute beginners

There are several things required to get started with MXPaper.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is requirement for using MXPaper, as it is made for use with the Kotlin programming language.

You can start learning Kotlin with [the official docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) or by using
the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview).

## Gradle

You should be able to use Gradle as your build system, although you do not have to understand to much of it. Probably it
will even work if you just copy and paste the snippets this guide provides.

## Paper

Paper is just an API, meaning that if you are able to use Kotlin, you will be able to use an API like Paper and MXPaper.
Nevertheless, it is good to know at least something about the Paper API.
