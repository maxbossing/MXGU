The entrypoint in MXPaper is a class which represents the main class of your plugin.

???+ warning "Type of the main class"
    Please note that due to a limitation of Spigot, your main class has to be a `class`, it cannot be an `object` or anything else.

## Create the main class

Create a new file at `src/main/kotlin/your/package/structure/` and call it (for example) `Manager`.

Add the following class to the file:

```kotlin
class InternalMainClass : MXPaper() {
    override fun load() { }
    override fun startup() { }
    override fun shutdown() { }
}
```

??? info "Coming from Paper or Spigot?"
    When using MXPaper **do not inherit from `JavaPlugin`**, inherit from `MXPaper` instead.

??? info 
    You need to set the `prefix` Variable in your `load()` or `startup()`. This is used for messages the Plugins send


    Also, please note that:
    
    - `onLoad` becomes `load`
    - `onEnable` becomes `startup`
    - `onDisable` becomes `shutdown`

???+ warning "Be careful with the `load` function"
    The `load()` function is called earlier than the safe `startup()` function.
    During that time not all functionality of Spigot is available to your plugin, therefore you should prefer the
    `startup()` function if possible.

### Make it globally available

As noted above you cannot use `object` for the main class. Fortunately, due to the fact that there should always only exist one instance of your main class, you can provide it globally by building the main class as follows:

```kotlin
class InternalMainClass : MXPaper() {
    companion object {
        lateinit var INSTANCE: InternalMainClass; private set
    }

    override fun load() {
        INSTANCE = this
    }

    override fun startup() { }
    
    override fun shutdown() { }
}

val Manager by lazy { InternalMainClass.INSTANCE }
```
