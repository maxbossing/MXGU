# The enabled translations
# The first one will be used as a fallback and therefore should (like really) be complete (all keys set)
#
# Add as many translations as you want (create a new file for each)
# The file must be named like the language code
# i.E. messages_en.properties for English,
# messages_en_us.properties for American English
# messages_en_uk.properties for British English, etc.
# Then add the language code (en, en_us, en_uk, etc.) to this list
